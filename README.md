# Simple Rule-Based Chatbot with DialoGPT
# Chatbot with Hugging Face Transformers and Gradio
## Project Overview

This project is a simple chatbot built using the Hugging Face Transformers library and Gradio for the web interface. It uses Microsoft's DialoGPT-small model to generate conversational responses and includes a set of predefined rules for common greetings and questions.

The chatbot is deployed as a Hugging Face Space, demonstrating deployment of NLP models with an interactive UI.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
  
Deployment
This chatbot is deployed as a Hugging Face Space. The requirements.txt ensures the necessary libraries are installed during deployment.
deployment link: https://huggingface.co/spaces/zahraa12355/chatbot2

Usage:
Type messages into the chat box
Some greetings have predefined answers for quick responses
For other inputs, the chatbot generates replies using DialoGPT

Limitations and Future Work:
Currently uses DialoGPT-small, which can produce generic or repetitive answers
laptop couldnt handle large models to train better bots 
Conversation history is limited and not optimized for long interactions
Plans to improve prompt formatting and switch to more powerful models
Adding features like chat history saving, reset button, and better UI styling
