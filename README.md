## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

**Pre_Trained Bot** is a simple chatbot combining **rule-based responses** with a **pretrained model (`DialoGPT-small`)** to handle open-ended conversations.  
This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a chatbot using:

- [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/)  
- [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) for the web interface  

The bot includes:  
- Rule-based responses for common greetings  
- Generative replies for other user inputs using DialoGPT-small  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Features

- Predefined responses for greetings and FAQs  
- Dynamic responses via DialoGPT-small  
- Simple Gradio UI for interaction  
- Runs on CPU (no GPU required)  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Deployment

- Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces using `requirements.txt` for dependencies.  
- Temporary deployment via Google Colab for 7 days: [Live Demo](https://df987044db541eb781.gradio.live)  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Usage

1. Type messages into the chat box  
2. Predefined greetings will return instant responses  
3. Other messages are handled dynamically by DialoGPT-small  
4. Chat history is limited; the bot works best for short conversations  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Limitations & Future Work

- Currently uses **DialoGPT-small**, which may produce generic or repetitive answers  
- Laptop hardware limits training of larger models  
- Conversation history is limited and not optimized for long interactions  
- Future improvements:  
  - Better prompt formatting  
  - Upgrading to more powerful models  
  - Saving chat history  
  - Adding a reset button  
  - Improved UI styling  
  - Fix deployment issues on Hugging Face Spaces
